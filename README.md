Audiostreamer for iOS
======================================================

This is based on Matt Gallagher's Audiostreamer project. I used it to 3 of my apps and want to share my adds to the project.

Ignore the Mac-part in this project. I will only focus on the iPhone project.

* ACC+ support (buggy)
* MIMEType checks
