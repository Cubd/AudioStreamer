A fork of jfricker's AudioStreamer (which is a fork of the original AudioStreamer by mattgallagher)

Forked this to get a number of community addons:
- Shoutcast metadata
- MIME type detection
- HE-AACv2
- Level Metering
- NSThread memory leak

I made a few fixes:
- Interruption crashes
- Background buffering
- Play/pause from iPod controls

My TODO:
- Fix notification spam
- Make sure UI is not being updated in background / Update on foregrounding
- Retina display example
