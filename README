A fork of jfricker's AudioStreamer (which is a fork of the original AudioStreamer by mattgallagher)

Forked this to get a number of community addons:
- Shoutcast metadata
- MIME type detection
- HE-AACv2
- Level Metering
- NSThread memory leak

I made a few fixes:
- Interruption crashes
- Background buffering
- Play/pause from iPod controls
- Stop all UI updating and timers while backgrounded
- Retina display example
- Support for Pause button in UI
- Local Notifications (outside app) on error

My TODO:
- Fix alert spam / Invisible alerts (only happens in app)?
